# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA) AND CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING ON DIABETES PREDICTION.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important step in analyzing any dataset, Including Diabetes data. EDA helps to identify patterns, relationships, visualization and trends in the data, and to discover any inconsistencies or anomalies that may require further investigation.
In this analysis, we have chosen the Random Forest classifier as our model. The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes for classification or mean prediction of the individual trees for regression.
